I know Jehovah is my buddy, always by my side,
 When I’m feeling mad or worried, He’s my place to hide.
 He’s the one who truly loves me, faithful through and through,
 Every single step I take, I know He’s pulling me through.
He made all humankind from the dust of the ground,
 Spoke a word of life and turned silence to sound.
 When I feel unsure, He reminds me what’s right,
 I know Jehovah helps me morning and night.
Chorus
 I know Jehovah is my buddy, yes, I know it’s true,
 When I’m grumpy or I’m tired, He knows what to do.
 He knows what is best for me, better than I see,
 I love Jehovah when I’m ready, He waits patiently.
Verse 2
 He gives me food on my table, a roof over me,
 Gave me my mommy’s love, gentle and free.
 Gave me my daddy, strong, caring, and kind,
 Every single blessing was perfectly timed.
He created all humankind, every girl, every boy,
 Filled my days with purpose, filled my heart with joy.
 I love my whole family, everything I see,
 Every good thing in my life was given to me.
Outro
 I love this mommy He gave me, I love this daddy too,
 I’m thankful every day for the things that You do.
 I know Jehovah is my buddy, forever I’ll be,
 Grateful for the love and the life You gave me.

He knows every thought I think before I even speak,
 Every word in my heart, even when I’m weak.
 My heart spills through my mouth, truth on my tongue,
 Jehovah hears my prayers when I’m old or young.
I know Jehovah is my buddy, always by my side,
 When the world feels heavy, He becomes my guide.
 Jehovah leads me through the day, shows me what is right,
 Even in the darkness, He brings the light.
Chorus
 I hate Satan, but I love Jehovah, that’s the truth I say,
 Satan pulls you down, but Jehovah shows the way.
 Think, think, think before you choose your lane,
 Jehovah brings the peace, Satan brings the pain.
Verse 2
 Satan’s lost and broken, living in despair,
 He lies and tries to trap you, but Jehovah’s always there.
 He tricks your mind with bad things you’re not supposed to do,
 But Jehovah leads you right, faithful and true.
Satan tries to bring me down, fills the day with doubt,
 Jehovah lifts me up, pushes darkness out.
 When Satan hates the world and spreads his fear,
 Jehovah shows me love, reminds me He is near.
Chorus
 I hate Satan, but I love Jehovah, every night and day,
 Satan leads you wrong, Jehovah leads the way.
 Think, think, think, let your heart be strong,
 Jehovah is the right path, Satan is the wrong.
Verse 3
 Back in Eden’s garden, perfect and bright,
 Jehovah made a home filled with life and light.
 So many fruits to eat, so much joy to see,
 Everything they needed lived in harmony.
But Satan, jealous, wanted praise and fame,
 Jehovah had the glory, Satan had the shame.
 He turned into a snake, full of lies and pride,
 Tricked Eve with his words, pulled Adam to his side.
Adam knew the truth but still disobeyed,
 They sinned against Jehovah, and the price was paid.
 Now people grow old, and one day we all die,
 Because of that lie in the garden long ago, that’s why.
Outro
 But Jehovah still loves us, still shows the way,
 Guides us through our lives every single day.
 I hate Satan, but I love Jehovah, that’s who I’ll obey,
 Jehovah is my buddy — forever I’ll stay.

I may not see Jehovah in His truest light,
 But I know He’s always with me, day and night.
 Looking down on me, smiling when I do what’s right,
 Every good little choice fills His heart with delight.
When I help someone out, when I say “good day,”
 Or whisper “good night” at the end of my way,
 I know He is watching, I know He is near,
 Even when I don’t see Him, His presence is clear.
I can’t hear His voice, I can’t see His face,
 But I feel His spirit, His love, His grace.
 I can’t hear Him speak, I can’t see His care,
 But deep in my heart, I know He is there.
He’s watching over me with angels untold,
 A billion unseen, strong, shining, and bold.
 Watching over me, guarding my way,
 With angels around me both night and day.
I know one day this whole world will end,
 But I’ll be by His side, my forever friend.
 He’ll be there when I need Him, when hope feels thin,
 He is my Savior, my hope, my win.
He listens to my prayers, even at midnight,
 One, two, or three, He’s always in sight.
 He hears every word, every thought I share,
 Every hope, every dream, He’s always there.
He’s always awake, listening to what I say,
 Every move that I make, every step on my way.
 What I think, what I preach, every action I do,
 Every word from my heart, He always sees through.
Chorus
 I can’t see Him, but I feel Him near,
 Smiling at me, bringing me cheer.
 Jehovah, I love You, You’re my strength and guide,
 I’ll follow Your ways, with You by my side.
Verse 2
 Kingdoms may fall, the world will end,
 But life with Jehovah will never bend.
 No sickness, no pain, no tears to cry,
 Free to explore under His sky.
Ride with the tigers, swim with the whales,
 Adventure awaits, beyond all trails.
 The world may pass, but what comes after,
 Is a life full of love, joy, and laughter.
Bridge
 People may doubt, but I feel His might,
 He gives me breath, He gives me light.
 Every day I wake, I never regret,
 His love fills my soul, I’ll never forget.Satan may try, but he can’t take my soul,
Jehovah’s the keeper, He makes me whole.
Outro
 I love Him with my heart, I love Him with my soul,
 Jehovah is my guide, my rock, my goal.
 Nothing will change me, I’m bold and I see,
 Forever with Him, is where I’ll be.
